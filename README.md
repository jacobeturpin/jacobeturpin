I'm Jacob, and I like to work with data. I build various projects in the data science space both professionally and in my spare time. 

# My Day Job

I currently work at [ConnectWise](https://www.connectwise.com/) as the manager of product data science where I lead a team data science professionals in helping solve problems faced by IT professionals and Technology As-a-Service businesses.

# What I'm Learning

In the evenings, I'm a student at Northwestern University [Master's in Data Science](https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/index.php). This quarter, I'm currently working on generalized linear models.

# What I'm Working On

Outside work and studies, here's what you'll find me doing:

* Tinkering with the latest fad in the machine learning community
* Creating toy models for sports analytics
* Working on small contributions to OSS libraries
