I'm Jacob, and I like to work with data. I build various projects in the AI products and analytics spaces -- both professionally and in my spare time. 

# My Day Job

I currently work at [Avodah]([https://www.connectwise.com/](https://www.avodah.com/)) as the head of engineering for the AvodahConnect business unit. I have the pleasure of leading a global engineering team build AI products that provides solutions for real-time translation, transcription, language preservation, and language education.

# What I'm Learning

In the evenings, I'm trying to continuously improve my full-stack engineering skillset to better assist the full-stack teams teams I lead. (Academically and professionally I've spent more time in machine learning than application development.) I'm currently tinkering with small scale applications on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

# What I'm Working On

Outside work and studies, here's what you'll find me doing:

* Tinkering with the latest fad in the machine learning community (right now, it's the open source LLMs and RAG-based patterns)
* Creating toy models for sports analytics
* Working on small contributions to OSS libraries
