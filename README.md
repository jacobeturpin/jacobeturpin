I'm Jacob, and I like to work with data. I build various projects in the AI products and analytics spaces -- both professionally and in my spare time. 

# My Day Job

I currently work at [Avodah](https://www.avodah.com/) as the head of engineering for the AvodahConnect business unit. I have the pleasure of leading a global engineering team in building AI products that provides solutions for real-time translation, transcription, language preservation, and language education.

# What I'm Learning

In the evenings, I'm trying to continuously improve my full-stack AI engineering skillset to better assist the teams I lead. I'm currently working on a proof-of-concept for integrating agentic AI into voice applications.

# What I'm Working On

Outside work and studies, here's what you'll find me doing:

* Tinkering with the latest fad in the machine learning community (right now, it's the open source LLMs and RAG-based patterns)
* Creating toy models for sports analytics
* Working on small contributions to OSS libraries
